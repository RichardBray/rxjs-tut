# Teaching myself some RxJs

This is gonna be a pretty unorganised scrapbook of my RxJs findings and experiments used for reference only.

### Dev Dependencies used

On the off chance I'll need this exact same setup again, here's the command to install them all.

```bash
$ npm i -D webpack webpack-dev-server uglifyjs-webpack-plugin@1.0.0-beta.1 html-webpack-plugin
```

Of course not forgetting to update the `package.json` scripts section with;

```json
  "start": "webpack-dev-server"
```
